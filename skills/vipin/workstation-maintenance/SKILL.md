# Workstation Maintenance

Use this skill for whole-computer maintenance: C/D/G drive inventory, safe file organization, agent infrastructure routing, and coordinated updates between `D:\devtools`, `D:\agent-resources`, and `D:\Research\vipin's knowledgebase`.

This skill owns physical file organization. The `vipin-wiki` skill owns public-safe wiki updates after a dry run or an approved move changes state.

## Hard Boundaries

- Never move, delete, recurse into, or depend on contents under `D:\Research`.
- Treat any resolved path under `D:\Research` as protected even if reached through a junction, symlink, relative path, or different casing.
- C: is in scope for inventory and classification, but Windows, Program Files, ProgramData, AppData, package caches, browser profiles, auth/session/db/log directories, active repos, and reparse points are no-move by default.
- D: is in scope except `D:\Research`; important roots such as `D:\devtools`, `D:\agent-resources`, `D:\devtools-public`, `D:\Company`, `D:\Project`, `D:\Healthcare`, `D:\Game_develop`, `D:\frontend`, and `D:\WeipingYan_portfolio` are routing records by default, not move targets.
- Do not delete files. Deletion can only be a later candidate list with explicit user approval.
- Do not read sensitive file contents for classification; use path and filename patterns only.
- Do not execute a physical move without a manifest, a move plan, an explicit batch ID from the user, and rollback metadata.

## Workflow

1. Preflight
   - Check git status for `vipinknowledge`, `agent-resources`, `devtools`, and `devtools-public`.
   - Run `D:\devtools\health-check.ps1`, `agentmemory status`, and `python scripts/wiki.py maintain --scope whole-computer --json` from `vipinknowledge`.
   - Record unrelated dirty files and leave them untouched.

2. Inventory
   - Run `scripts/New-WorkstationInventory.ps1`.
   - Store generated JSON/Markdown under ignored `.wiki-tmp/workstation-maintenance/` when working from `vipinknowledge`.
   - Confirm there are zero entries under `D:\Research` and zero move-eligible reparse points, directories, or git worktrees.

3. Plan
   - Run `scripts/New-MovePlan.ps1` against the inventory manifest.
   - By default, executable batches include only low-risk candidates older than 30 days; recent candidates are deferred for review so normal use is not disrupted.
   - Batches are grouped by file type and capped at 100 items by default so the user can approve narrow, understandable units.
   - Review batch IDs, categories, subcategories, part numbers, item counts, size, target root, age gate, and risk tier.
   - Present only public-safe batch summaries in chat/wiki. Do not list sensitive filenames in public wiki pages.

4. Approval Gate
   - Stop before moving files.
   - Ask the user to approve one or more batch IDs.
   - Use `scripts/Invoke-ApprovedMoveBatch.ps1 -Approved` only after explicit approval.

5. Rollback And Validation
   - Every applied batch must write an applied manifest with rollback source/destination fields.
   - Use `scripts/Invoke-RollbackBatch.ps1` if the user asks to undo an applied batch.
   - Run `scripts/Test-WorkstationMaintenance.ps1` after script changes.

6. Wiki Sync
   - After dry-run inventory or approved movement, update `vipinknowledge` through `vipin-wiki`.
   - Public wiki pages should record roots, buckets, policy, counts, and safety boundaries, not private document details.

7. Agent Infrastructure Sync
   - Keep shared skill source in `D:\agent-resources\skills\vipin\workstation-maintenance`.
   - Expose to Codex and Claude/OpenCode through junctions or symlinks under `D:\devtools`.
   - Update `D:\agent-resources\SKILL-INDEX.md`, `D:\agent-resources\README.md`, `D:\devtools\README.md`, and `vipinknowledge` agent docs together.

## Standard Commands

From `D:\Research\vipin's knowledgebase`:

```powershell
$out = "D:\Research\vipin's knowledgebase\.wiki-tmp\workstation-maintenance"
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "D:\agent-resources\skills\vipin\workstation-maintenance\scripts\New-WorkstationInventory.ps1" -OutputDir $out
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "D:\agent-resources\skills\vipin\workstation-maintenance\scripts\New-MovePlan.ps1" -ManifestPath "<manifest.json>"
```

`New-MovePlan.ps1` defaults to `-MinimumAgeDays 30 -MaxItemsPerBatch 100`. Lower the age gate only when the user explicitly accepts the higher risk of moving recent files.

Approved movement, only after the user names a batch ID:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "D:\agent-resources\skills\vipin\workstation-maintenance\scripts\Invoke-ApprovedMoveBatch.ps1" -MovePlanPath "<move-plan.json>" -BatchId "batch-downloads-archives-old" -Approved
```

Rollback:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "D:\agent-resources\skills\vipin\workstation-maintenance\scripts\Invoke-RollbackBatch.ps1" -AppliedManifestPath "<applied-batch.json>"
```
